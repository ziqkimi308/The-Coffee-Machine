### The Coffee Machine

- The Coffee Machine project is a simulation of a coffee vending machine that can serve multiple types of coffee. It allows users to order different drinks (latte, espresso, cappuccino), checks if the machine has enough resources to make the order, processes payments, and deducts the ingredients used. The program also tracks the current profit and available resources, offering a simple yet interactive way to run a coffee machine.

### Features:

- Coffee Menu: Offers multiple coffee types (latte, espresso, cappuccino) with customizable ingredients (water, milk, coffee).
- Resource Management: The coffee machine checks if there are enough ingredients (water, milk, coffee) to fulfill an order.
- Payment System: Users can insert coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) to pay for their orders. If the payment is sufficient, the machine serves the coffee.
- Profit Tracking: The machine keeps track of the total profit from all successful transactions.
- Reports: Users can check the status of the resources and the total profit of the machine.
